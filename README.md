# Interactive Form

Welcome to my full stack conference interactive form.

In this project, I'm going for Exceeds Expectations:

1. Color‚Äù drop down menu is hidden until a T-Shirt design is selected.
2. Form provides real-time error message as soon as user starts typing email. If the email is invalid, there is a red border around input box. Once a valid email has been typed in, the box is longer red.
3. Form provides a special error message at the bottom of the form if any of the credit card information entered is incorrect (credit card number, zip code, CVV)
